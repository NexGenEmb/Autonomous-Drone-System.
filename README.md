Technologies: ATmega328P, Embedded C, RF Communication, MATLAB, Power Electronics

Designed and built a custom RF-controlled drone using an ATmega328P microcontroller, programmed in C, with real-time telemetry and Xbox controller input.

Engineered an auto-brake landing safety system to stabilize touchdown and prevent motor overrun, improving landing reliability and hardware protection.

Optimized RF communication protocols and onboard power management, extending effective flight range by approximately 25%.

Validated control algorithms and system behavior using MATLAB-based signal analysis and simulations.

👉 This project clearly communicates embedded control, safety engineering, and system optimization.
